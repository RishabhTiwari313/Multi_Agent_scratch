# Multi_Agent_scratch

The Multi-Agents AI System from Scratch is a Python-based application leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4o model to perform specialized tasks through a collaborative multi-agent architecture. Built with Streamlit for an intuitive web interface without any Agents frameworks/libraries, this system includes agents for summarizing medical texts, writing research articles, and sanitizing medical data (Protected Health Information - PHI). Each primary agent is paired with a corresponding validator agent to ensure the quality and accuracy of the outputs. Built it for beginners so they can understand that Agents can be built without orchestration frameworks like Crew AI, AutoGen, LangGraph, etc.

Summarize Medical Texts: Generate concise summaries of lengthy medical documents.
Write Research Articles: Create detailed research articles based on a given topic and optional outline.
Sanitize Medical Data (PHI): Remove sensitive health information from medical datasets.
Quality Validation: Each primary task is accompanied by a validator agent to assess and ensure output quality.
Robust Logging: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging purposes.
User-Friendly Interface: Streamlit-based web app for easy interaction and task management.
